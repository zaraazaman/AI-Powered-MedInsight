# 🩺 Health Care Recommendation System - Enhanced Agentic Workflow Analysis

## 📋 Executive Summary

Your health care recommendation system has been enhanced with a sophisticated **multi-agent architecture** that leverages MedLLAMA2 to provide comprehensive medical analysis through coordinated specialist agents. The system now features workflow transparency, specialist consultations, and intelligent routing.

## 🔄 Enhanced Agentic Workflow Architecture

### **Core Orchestrator Agent**

- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically determines which specialists to consult based on symptoms

### **Specialist Agents**
1. **CardiologyAgent**: Cardiovascular conditions, chest pain assessment (HEART Score)
2. **NeurologyAgent**: Neurological conditions, headache evaluation (SNNOOP10)
3. **PharmacologyAgent**: Medication management, drug interactions, therapy optimization
4. **EmergencyAgent**: Urgency triage, red flag detection, disposition planning

### **Supporting Agents**
- **DiagnosisAgent**: Primary medical assessment and symptom validation
- **TreatmentAgent**: Evidence-based treatment planning
- **MonitoringAgent**: Patient health tracking and trend analysis
- **ReportAgent**: Formal medical report generation

- Conversation memory utilization
- Specialist consultation history
- Progressive diagnostic refinement

## 🚀 Key Improvements Implemented

### **1. Workflow Transparency**
```python
workflow_log = {
    "steps": ["Initial Triage", "Primary Diagnosis", "Specialist Consultation"],
    "agents_consulted": ["diagnosis_agent", "cardiology_agent"],
    "confidence_scores": {},
    "recommendations": ["Follow-up in 24-48 hours"]
}
```

### **2. Intelligent Specialist Routing**
```python
def determine_specialist_consultation(symptoms, diagnosis):
    # Automatically routes to appropriate specialists
    # cardiology, neurology, pharmacology based on symptoms
```

### **3. Enhanced Safety Validation**
```python
def validate_treatment_safety(symptoms, diagnosis, treatment):
    # Checks for drug interactions, contraindications
    # Returns safety assessment with risk levels
```

### **4. Emergency Triage System**
```python
def triage_urgency(symptoms):
    # IMMEDIATE, URGENT, LESS_URGENT, NON_URGENT
    # Provides disposition: 911, ED, URGENT_CARE, PRIMARY_CARE
```
